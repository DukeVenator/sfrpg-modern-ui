# Project Maintenance Update

As of May 2025, this project is now maintained by DukeVenator. The original author, coboye, appears to be no longer maintaining the project. I have taken over to ensure continued support and development for the community.

## Future Plans
- Add further mod support for enhanced customization and integration.
- Expand compatibility with the latest version of Starfinder for Foundry VTT v13.
- Continue improving the user experience and keeping the module up to date with Foundry VTT changes.

If you have suggestions or encounter issues, please open an issue or pull request. Thank you for your support!
